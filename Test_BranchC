Repository: 

Create a project repository in GitHub.
Clone that repository to your local machine.
To work on something new, create a descriptively-named branch on GitHub.
Create a branch with the same name on your local repository. Pull the GitHub branch to your local branch.
Follow the workflow on your local machine as mentioned from the previous sections of this course.
Regularly push your work to the GitHub branch! (After every major commit on your local machine.)
